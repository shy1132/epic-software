very useful...

u need bun installed to build, but it can run in terminal with node or bun \
im quite aware that the built installer executable is needlessly huge, im just too lazy to fix it because this is joke software

## support
**windows** support works fine and should require no further configuration

**linux** support is iffy, it depends on your distro and desktop environment, but if you have **systemd** and you use the **kde**, **gnome**, **cinnamon**, or **xfce** desktop environment then it should work

### enjoy...
